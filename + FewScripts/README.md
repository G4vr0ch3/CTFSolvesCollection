# My Python Suite

Here are just a few scripts that serve multiple purposes.
No support will be given relative to these scripts.
Some of these scripts are not even fully working, they can be just concepts, ideas etc.
Feel free to copy them, edit them, use them, whatever.
Feel free to submit any improvement at gavrochebackups@gmail.com

Cheers !
